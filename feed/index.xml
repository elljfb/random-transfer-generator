<p>Nowadays, if you want to play a football management game, the only real option you have is the <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/">Football Manager</a> series, but back in the early 2000s there were a whole host of different football management games to choose from.</p>



<p>You can also view this article in video format below:</p>

<iframe title="The Football Manager Games You Didn&#039;t Know Existed" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yswYfilYYMI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Championship Manager</h2>



<p id="35ca">The most similar game to Football Manager was of course Championship Manager. In fact, they started out as the same game until the developers, Sports Interactive, and the publishers, Eidos, split in 2003. Sports Interactive kept the game, engine and database and launched Football Manager whereas Eidos kept the name and paired up with a new development studio to continue making Championship Manager.</p>



<p id="7c88">The gameplay was very similar to the original game, but it didn’t quite match up to the familiar game that everyone already loved. It had a similar 2D match engine and even had a licensing deal with Adidas, but fans quickly started switching over to Football Manager.</p>



<p id="365a">After sales began to fall year after year, Eidos decided to pull the plug on Championship Manager, and after a failed Mobile-Only relaunch in the following decade, they finally gave up. The last full PC Championship Manager game was released in 2011, with the mobile game lasting 5 years before Championship Manager was cancelled for good.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">LMA Manager</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="LMA Manager 2007 Gameplay 2021 (PCSX2/MacBook Pro)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tu-fiixlv2U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p id="ef01">One of the most popular football management games of the 2000s was LMA Manager. The console focused game was easily available on the PS2 and offered a 3D match engine which Football Manager didn’t have at the time. The graphics were similar to that of FIFA and PES and this opened up the market to people who didn’t like the spreadsheet look and feel of Football Manager and Championship Manager.</p>



<p id="adc5">The game allowed you to build and upgrade your stadium, create your own team and even had a Match of the Day style highlight show with commentary from Gary Lineker himself.</p>



<p id="19f4">The game was canceled after the release of LMA Manager 2007 as the software the game ran on had issues with newer hardware, but LMA Manager will always remain a fond memory of players in the early 2000s and who could forget some of the great songs used in the intros to the games.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">FIFA Manager</h2>



<p id="aa0b">FIFA Manager, or Total Club Manager as it was also called, was EA Sport’s attempt at entering the management simulation market. Utilising the game engine from their popular FIFA Football games, FIFA Manager offered fans something recognisable when playing, compared to the 2D match engine of Football Manager.</p>



<p id="33b4">A big thing for players of FIFA Manager was the official licenses the game had due to EA Sports deals with the FIFA organisation. Leagues and Clubs around the world had their official badges and kits, and the game used real player faces compared to other football management games who had very few official licenses.</p>



<p id="adf3">The game also had a sort of role playing element which allowed the player to spend their managers wages on things like houses, cars and other goods, even if they couldn’t actually do anything with them.</p>



<p id="89e7">EA Sports announced that after the release of FIFA Manager 2014 that they would be canceling the series after poor sales compared to Football Manager. Some fans of the game still play it though, with a small community providing seasonal updates each year so that the game lives on.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pro Evolution Soccer Management</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="PES Manager Gameplay In 2023" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_WnqNaTqVTo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p id="03b0">Most people who played football games throughout the 2000s probably aren’t even aware there ever was a Pro Evolution Soccer Management game, but in 2006 Konami released their entry into the genre. The PS2 only release was supposed to rival FIFA Manager, just as Pro Evolution Soccer had been the main rival to the FIFA series, but only the 1 instalment was ever released.</p>



<p id="0e76">The game featured the same match engine as PES and shared the few official licenses that game had, but errors in spelling and a slow gameplay put players off. Pro Evolution Soccer Management did feature some role-playing aspects such as having to hire a secretary and having face to face meetings with various staff members and new signings but it wasn’t enough to challenge the already established football management franchises.</p>



<p id="2b40">Konami did release a mobile version of the game during the 2010s, which featured official licenses from various teams each season, but when they rebranded PES to eFootball, they decided to discontinue updates and remove it from the app store.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Let’s Make A Soccer Team!</h2>



<p id="9cbd">Probably the strangest feature on this list is Let’s Make a Soccer Team! The game was more like a football club chairman simulator but did let you control the tactics of the team as well. It was very similar to Pro Evolution Soccer Management in how it looked and played, and released in Europe in 2006 as an adaptation of a Japanese game.</p>



<p id="9153">Let’s Make a Soccer Team! was unlike all the other games available in the fact that it had a storyline, in which you had an antagonist who was the chairman of a rival club and who you came across throughout the game. You also couldn’t manage a real club in the game, hence the title. The start of the game also made you take part in a play-off, and if you lost you had to start again, which annoyed players because you couldn’t just instantly start like the other football management games.</p>



<p id="0b57">Only the single instalment was ever released, as publishers SEGA, who also publish Football Manager, decided to focus on the already popular franchise instead of publishing new competitors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Football shirts in the 1980s made a bold statement by embracing the audacious styles and culture of the decade.</strong> As synthetic fabrics replaced traditional cotton, kit designs moved into daring new territory with abstract graphics, geometric patterns and vivid neon hues. Teams pushed the boundaries with shirts in bright greens, electric pinks, and citrus yellows that exemplified 1980s flair. Loud designs like Belgium’s red and black geometric patterned home shirt from 1984 burn themselves into fans’ memories. Other kits made a statement with multicoloured zig-zags, paint-splatter motifs, and clashing blocks of colour. By borrowing themes from 80s fashion, music and pop culture, football shirts shed their traditional looks and captured the brash, larger-than-life vibe that defined the decade. This article will explore some of the most memorable and emblematic 1980s football shirts that seamlessly embraced the style of the times.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="736" height="414" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/alan-ball-england-bobby-charlton-world-cup-final-west-germany_3395703.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-78" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/alan-ball-england-bobby-charlton-world-cup-final-west-germany_3395703.jpeg 736w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/alan-ball-england-bobby-charlton-world-cup-final-west-germany_3395703-300x169.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">England’s 1966 World Cup shirt epitomized the simple, cotton designs prevalent before the 1980s.

<p>Prior to the 1980s, football shirt design remained relatively traditional and understated. Most clubs wore simple stripes, blocks of colour, or the occasional monochrome look. Natural fibers like cotton, wool and linen were standard, limiting bold patterns and colours. However, the late 1970s saw synthetic fabrics like polyester emerge, allowing for more experimentation. Sportswear brands <a href="https://adidas.com/">Adidas</a>, <a href="https://umbro.com/">Umbro</a> and <a href="https://puma.com/">Puma</a> began developing shirts with bold new designs to suit the materials. By the 1980s, shirts moved further from their pedestrian roots with abstract graphics, daring geometrics and vivid neon palettes. New screen-printing and dyeing techniques opened up creative possibilities. As sponsors and brands became more prominent, they encouraged custom designs that made a statement. This intersection of sport, fashion and advertising in the 1980s propelled football shirts into uncharted visual territory.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Netherlands Adidas Home Shirt (1988)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/netherlands-1988-1024x576.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-79" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/netherlands-1988-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/netherlands-1988-300x169.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/netherlands-1988-768x432.jpeg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/netherlands-1988.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Netherlands Adidas Kit at the 1988 European Championships (Image via Screenshot from YouTube)</figcaption></figure>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">West Germany Home Shirt (1988)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="988" height="556" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/european_championship_germany_v_denmark-1.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-81" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/european_championship_germany_v_denmark-1.jpeg 988w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/european_championship_germany_v_denmark-1-300x169.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/european_championship_germany_v_denmark-1-768x432.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 988px) 100vw, 988px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">West Germany 1988 Adidas Home Kit (Image via UEFA)</figcaption></figure>



<p>This patriotic home shirt from the 1988 Euros contained an abstract graphic print of the German flag which went with the Adidas branding. The visual embodied the country’s vibrant pop culture scene.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Fiorentina Home Shirt (1981-1983)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="575" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/fiorentina1982-1024x575.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-82" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/fiorentina1982-1024x575.jpeg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/fiorentina1982-300x169.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/fiorentina1982-768x432.jpeg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/fiorentina1982-1536x863.jpeg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/fiorentina1982.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Fiorentina Home Shirt in 1982 (Image via http://soccernostalgia.blogspot.com/)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The iconic purple home shirts made by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jdfarrows/">J.D Farrow’s</a> featured a huge club badge on the front which style was repeated on the back for the player’s kit number. The bright red V-neck and collar also stand out.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Ajax Amsterdam Away Shirt (1989-90)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="505" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ajax.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-83" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ajax.jpeg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ajax-300x197.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>Ajax’s rare blue, red and white abstract away kit exemplified the novelty and creativity of the era. Its bold diamond design was a striking symbol of Dutch style.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The 80’s Style</h2>



<p>Several design motifs defined the bold new football aesthetic of the 1980s. Vibrant, eye-catching colours like bright yellow, neon pink, and electric blue replaced traditional shades. Striped, zig-zag, and abstract graphic prints brought art influences to the kits. Large geometric shapes and diagonal lines conveyed movement and energy. Stars, lightning bolts and other accents added striking details. Manufacturers like Adidas experimented with shoulder designs that extended across the chest. New technologies allowed for gradients, fades, and colour blending on fabric. These common elements came together to create shirts that perfectly aligned with music, fashion and culture in the 1980s. The decade proved that football kits could make provocative artistic statements beyond just team colours and logos.</p>



<p>The bold prints and colours of 1980s football shirts mirrored what was happening across music, fashion, and pop culture in the decade. Kits adopted the bright, neon palette that defined MTV music videos and new wave bands like The Police. Abstract shapes and patterns took inspiration from postmodern art and the Memphis Group furniture designers. Shoulder pad designs were borrowed straight from popular 80s fashions. The avant-garde, rule-breaking ethos of designers like Vivienne Westwood influenced shirts that broke conventions. Brand logos and sponsor placements grew driving commercial trends. Above all, the artful self-expression and experimentation that flourished in the 1980s as artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat redefined culture was embodied by football shirts adopting a similar groundbreaking spirit. The kits crossed over from sport into wider cultural style.</p>

<p>Star players and successful teams drove distinct shirt styles that fans wanted to emulate. Diego Maradona’s transfer to Napoli ignited demand for their light blue jerseys worldwide. Juventus’ Michel Platini wore the team’s iconic black and white stripes as he dominated Serie A. English clubs like Everton and Aston Villa gained international followings through European success, spreading their shirt designs globally. Real Madrid’s all-white look gained prestige as Hugo Sanchez starred for the club. For national teams, Brazilian great Socrates rocked an iconic yellow jersey that Pelé first popularized in the 1970s. On the club level, AC Milan’s Dutch trio Ruud Gullit, Marco van Basten and Frank Rijkaard made the red and black stripes fashionable. Whether through trophies, charisma or flashy styles, individual superstars and teams left an imprint on shirt trends during the decade.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Catapulting Kits into Pop Culture</h2>



<p>The rise of television broadcasts beaming matches into homes worldwide allowed kits to become bold fashion statements. As the sport gained more exposure, shirts adopted brighter palettes and abstract designs to stand out on the small screen. At the same time, corporate sponsorships on jerseys became more prominent. Brands like Coca-Cola, Adidas and Hitachi splashed their logos across shirt fronts, bringing commercialization. The need for shirts to function as both TV-friendly billboards for sponsors and visually striking team identifiers accelerated the artistic evolution. Loud colours, daring prints and prominent branding made kits pop on TV while giving brands coveted screen time. This synergy between television and sponsorships catapulted football shirts from athletic wear into mainstream pop culture.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="655" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/C-Wik1jXcAEuDf_-2048x1310-1-1024x655.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-88" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/C-Wik1jXcAEuDf_-2048x1310-1-1024x655.jpeg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/C-Wik1jXcAEuDf_-2048x1310-1-300x192.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/C-Wik1jXcAEuDf_-2048x1310-1-768x491.jpeg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/C-Wik1jXcAEuDf_-2048x1310-1-1536x983.jpeg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/C-Wik1jXcAEuDf_-2048x1310-1.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Liverpool’s 1981 home shirt with Hitachi as the sponsor (Image via Liverpool News on X)</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Back to the future</h2>



<p>Vintage 1980s shirt designs continue influencing the game today. Many clubs are marking anniversaries by bringing back classic designs from the decade. Liverpool recently revived their 1984-85 kit with the original Candy sponsor logo intact. Arsenal released a modern take on their famous yellow and blue zig-zag away strip from the early 90s. Tottenham incorporated their iconic ‘Holsten’ sponsor logo across new merchandise. Barcelona and Real Madrid pay homage to 80s kits yearly through retro third jerseys. The vintage trend satisfies nostalgia while underscoring the era’s lasting cultural impact. 3D graphic prints and neon colours from the 1980s even appear on contemporary kits as a callback. Though recreated with modern fits and fabrics, the retro motif proves today’s designers still draw inspiration from the audacious creativity that defined 1980s shirts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="481" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/united-originals-in-post-1024x481.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-89" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/united-originals-in-post-1024x481.jpeg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/united-originals-in-post-300x141.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/united-originals-in-post-768x361.jpeg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/united-originals-in-post-1536x721.jpeg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/united-originals-in-post.jpeg 1704w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Manchester United and Adidas re-release their kit from the late 80’s (Image via Adidas UK)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The 1980s represented a transformative period for football kit design, when shirts evolved from plain athletic gear into bold pop culture statements. Advances in printing and fabrics allowed designers to experiment with dazzling colours, stripes, shapes and graphics that captured the decade’s avant-garde spirit. Players and teams left an indelible mark on shirt trends through their success and charisma. Television broadcasts and sponsorships accelerated kits shedding their traditional looks for innovative, artistic expression. The era produced some of the most recognizable and aesthetically daring jerseys in history, which still inspire nostalgia and retro revivals today. The 1980s proved football shirts could make provocative artistic statements far beyond just team colours and badges. The decade paved the way for today’s designers to treat kits as contemporary culture pieces rather than merely functional sporting apparel.</p>

<p>The football world is no stranger to blockbuster transfers that shake things up and get fans buzzing. But every so often, a transfer deal comes along that truly shocks and rocks the sport. Whether it&#8217;s fierce rivals selling their best players to each other, record-breaking fees being paid, or controversial superstars switching sides unexpectedly, these moves make headlines and get people talking for years to come.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>10. Paul Pogba from Man United to Juventus (2012)</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pogba-1024x576.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-49" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pogba-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pogba-300x169.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pogba-768x432.jpeg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pogba-1536x864.jpeg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pogba.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Sir Alex Ferguson was left shocked when teenage midfielder Paul Pogba decided to walk away from Manchester United on a free transfer to join Juventus in 2012. Pogba grew frustrated by his lack of playing time at Old Trafford and opted to move abroad to gain more first-team opportunities. United fans were outraged that such a promising young talent was allowed to leave for nothing, especially when Pogba began fulfilling his immense potential in Serie A. His departure was the beginning of the fractured relationship between Pogba and Ferguson, who later stated his biggest management regret was not giving Pogba more of a chance to develop at United. Juventus gained a future superstar for free while United lost one, making it one of the most shocking transfers of money left on the table.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>9. Ronaldinho from PSG to Barcelona (2003)</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ronaldinho-1024x576.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-50" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ronaldinho-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ronaldinho-300x169.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ronaldinho-768x432.jpeg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ronaldinho-1536x864.jpeg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ronaldinho.jpeg 1648w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Barcelona pulled off a transfer coup in 2003 by signing Brazilian superstar Ronaldinho from Paris Saint-Germain for €30 million. Ronaldinho had shone at the 2002 World Cup, establishing himself as one of the most exciting talents in world football. His shock move to Barça came after Manchester United had failed to land the Brazilian earlier that summer. At the time, Barcelona were rebuilding after some lean years but Ronaldinho&#8217;s arrival signaled a change in fortune. His flair, skill, and infectious smile ushered in Barça&#8217;s era of dominance under Frank Rijkaard. Ronaldinho became a Camp Nou legend, leading Barcelona to back-to-back La Liga titles and their first Champions League in 14 years. Capturing his signature transformed the club&#8217;s fortunes, making this transfer a monumental and shocking turning point.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>8. Andy Carroll from Newcastle to Liverpool (2011)</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/andy-carroll-1024x576.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-51" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/andy-carroll-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/andy-carroll-300x169.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/andy-carroll-768x432.jpeg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/andy-carroll.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>On deadline day in January 2011, Liverpool pulled off one of the most shocking and expensive transfers in their history by signing Newcastle striker Andy Carroll for £35 million. This astonishingly high fee came mere hours after Liverpool had sold Fernando Torres to Chelsea for £50 million. Spending such a huge sum to replace Torres with Carroll, who had only shown glimpses of his potential, left many scratching their heads. The young English striker struggled with injuries and form at Anfield, scoring just 11 goals in 58 games before being loaned and eventually sold at a £20 million loss for Liverpool. Carroll&#8217;s exorbitant price tag and subsequent failure to deliver made this one of the most confusing and shocking transfer decisions, especially under the pressure of a deadline day.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>7. David Beckham from Man United to Real Madrid (2003)</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="538" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/beckham-1024x538.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-52" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/beckham-1024x538.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/beckham-300x158.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/beckham-768x403.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/beckham-1536x806.webp 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/beckham.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>David Beckham sent shockwaves through the football world when he left Manchester United to join Spanish giants Real Madrid in 2003. Beckham had become a global superstar at Old Trafford, helping United win six Premier League titles. However, his relationship with manager Sir Alex Ferguson deteriorated after an infamous dressing room incident. When Madrid came calling with a €35 million bid, Ferguson agreed to sell the England captain. Beckham&#8217;s departure rocked United fans while Madrid rejoiced signing one of football&#8217;s most marketable players ever. Beckham may have achieved more success at United but he become an icon in Madrid. His first Galactico signing ushered in Madrid&#8217;s era of lavish spending on superstar players, making this a landmark transfer that massively shocked football.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6. Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano to West Ham (2006)</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="489" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tevez-mascherano-1024x489.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-53" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tevez-mascherano-1024x489.webp 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tevez-mascherano-300x143.webp 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tevez-mascherano-768x367.webp 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tevez-mascherano-1536x734.webp 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tevez-mascherano-2048x979.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Two of South America&#8217;s biggest superstars, Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano, shocked world football by joining West Ham United in 2006. In a deadline day double deal, the Argentine duo signed for the struggling Premier League club from Brazilian team Corinthians. It was seen as a bizarre move for two players of such calibre to leave high profile clubs in South America to join West Ham, who were battling relegation. The transfers were facilitated by businessman Kia Joorabchian and were mired in controversy regarding third party ownership. Nevertheless, Tevez would go onto score the vital goals to keep West Ham up, endearing himself to fans. While Mascherano quickly departed for Liverpool, the shock arrivals of these two Argentina interntionals briefly made West Ham the talk of world football.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Ashley Cole from Arsenal to Chelsea (2006)</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="551" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cole-1024x551.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-54" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cole-1024x551.jpeg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cole-300x161.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cole-768x413.jpeg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cole.jpeg 1451w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>England left-back Ashley Cole caused outrage when he moved directly from Arsenal to rivals Chelsea in 2006 for £5 million and William Gallas. Cole had come up through the Arsenal academy but was part of the &#8216;Invincibles&#8217; side. However, after a tapping up scandal, where Chelsea were fined for illegally approaching Cole, the defender quickly pushed for a move. Arsenal fans labelled Cole &#8216;Cashley&#8217; and a traitor for forcing his way out to a direct rival. The controversial transfer shocked football given Cole&#8217;s status at Arsenal and the tense rivalry with Chelsea. Cole would go on to win further honours at Stamford Bridge, establishing himself as one of the world&#8217;s best left-backs.

<p>In a rare transfer between the bitter El Clasico rivals, Luis Enrique made a controversial switch directly from Real Madrid to Barcelona in 1996. The Spanish midfielder had come through Madrid&#8217;s youth system and played over 100 games for their first team. Moving directly to Barcelona was almost unheard of between the fiercely partisan clubs. Barcelona paid around £3 million to activate Enrique&#8217;s release clause, shocking Madrid fans. However, Enrique became a key player under Bobby Robson and Louis van Gaal, winning 2 consecutive La Ligas and the Copa del Rey. He endeared himself to Culés and scored against Los Blancos in his first Clasico appearance. While cross-city switches are more common nowadays, Enrique&#8217;s controversial transfer paved the way and shocked Spanish football at the time.</p>

<p>Sol Campbell caused outrage in 2001 when he crossed the North London divide to join rivals Arsenal on a free transfer from Tottenham. As Spurs captain, Campbell was a fan favorite during his 10 years there. His departure to Arsenal stunned the football world given the intense rivalry between the two clubs. Spurs fans branded Campbell &#8216;Judas&#8217; and a traitor for the shock move. Campbell proved critics wrong as he formed a legendary partnership with Tony Adams, winning 2 Premier League titles and 3 FA Cups with the Gunners. However, he forever ruined his reputation with Spurs supporters in an instant by joining their most despised rivals. The controversy and outrage sparked by Campbell&#8217;s transfer made it one of the most shocking moves in Premier League history.</p>

<p>Manchester City had already shocked football by being bought by Abu Dhabi owners, but the lavish spending reached new heights in 2008. On the same day Sheikh Mansour completed his City takeover, the club smashed the British transfer record to sign Brazilian star Robinho from Real Madrid for £32.5 million. Robinho was regarded as one of the most skillful wingers in the world during his time at Madrid. For him to leave the Santiago Bernabeu to join the Premier League&#8217;s perennial underachievers was astounding. City supporters could barely believe Robinho was wearing sky blue at the time. This mega-money transfer announced City&#8217;s arrival as a major force, backed by the immense wealth of their new owners. Signing a world-class talent like Robinho was a significant statement of intent that shocked football.</p>

<p>The world record €62 million transfer of Luis Figo from Barcelona to arch-rivals Real Madrid in 2000 sent shockwaves through football. Figo was a beloved star at the Camp Nou, winning two La Liga titles, two Copa del Reys, and the UEFA Cup Winners&#8217; Cup. However, Real Madrid triggered Figo&#8217;s record release clause and he made the controversial switch to the Bernabeu. Barcelona fans felt utterly betrayed and greeted Figo&#8217;s return with Barcelona with deafening boos and pig heads thrown on the pitch. The transfer fee was unprecedented at the time and Figo&#8217;s direct move embittered El Clasico forever. The Galacticos era was born at Madrid as Perez began his mission to assemble the world&#8217;s best players. While the move brought Figo success, he forever ruined his Barcelona legacy in an act of betrayal that will never be forgotten.</p>
